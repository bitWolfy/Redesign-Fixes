# e621 Redesign Fixes

This is a custom stylesheet that patches a number of bugs in the updated site theme. It is a combined work of several forum users, striving to bring back the old e621 look and feel that we all know and love.

## Installation:

#### Using e621 Custom CSS
- Open the [latest stylesheet release](https://re621.github.io/Redesign-Fixes/build/style.min.css), select and copy everything.
- On e621, go to Account > Settings > Advanced Settings > Custom CSS
- Paste the stylesheet there, then save.

#### Using a Userstyle Manager
- Open the [userstyle release](https://re621.github.io/Redesign-Fixes/build/style.user.css)
- Follow the instructions on the page

## Releases

| Latest Release | Userstyle | Legacy |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:------:|
| [style.min.css](https://re621.github.io/Redesign-Fixes/build/style.min.css) | [style.user.css](https://re621.github.io/Redesig-Fixes/build/style.user.css) | [legacy.css](https://re621.github.io/Redesign-Fixes/build/legacy.css) |

With version 2.0 came some changes that might not be to everyone's tastes. As such, I shall continue the maintenance and support of legacy version 1.51. It will receive bug fixes and patches, but no new content.

## Screenshots

Note that the stylesheet is in active development. The screenshots might not exactly match the current state of the project.
