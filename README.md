# e621 Redesign Fixes

This is a custom stylesheet that patches a number of bugs in the updated site theme. It is a combined work of several forum users, striving to bring back the old e621 look and feel that we all know and love.

## Installation:
- Open a stylesheet release page (links below), select and copy everything.
- On e621, go to Account > Settings > Advanced Settings > Custom CSS
- Paste the stylesheet there, then save.

(Optional, 2.0+ only)

- Install a browser extension that allows you to run userscripts, such as Tampermonkey
- Click on the userscript release page (link below)
- Select "install"

## Releases

**Latest release:** [stylesheet](https://re621.github.io/Redesign-Fixes/build/main.min.css) | [userscript](https://re621.github.io/Redesign-Fixes/build/script.user.js)

**Legacy 1.51:** [stylesheet](https://re621.github.io/Redesign-Fixes/build/legacy.css)

With version 2.0 came some changes that might not be to everyone's tastes. As such, I shall continue maintenance and support of legacy version 1.51. It will receive bug fixes and patches, but no new content.

## Screenshots

Note that the stylesheet is in active development. The screenshots might not exactly match the current state of the project.
